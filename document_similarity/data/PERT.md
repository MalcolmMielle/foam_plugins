# PERT charts

PERT (Product Evaluation and Review Techniques) charts are used to schedule, organize, and coordinate tasks.
They are used _before_ a project begins.
PERT charts map tasks in a flowchart and show the most optimist and pessimistic estimate of the work.

How to make a PERT chart:

1) List all project activities.
2) Classify tasks chronologically
3) Add tasks dependencies.
4) Draw network of paths.
5) Associate time frame with each task.
